https://summernote.org/ - Custom field RTE

## value-in-master-locale
Shows the value of some entry in the master language. Nice to have in localized versions of entries if you quickly want to see a field value from the master language.

Config Parameter example:

```
{
    "field_uid": "textfield",
    "master_locale": "en-us"
}
```

"field_uid" is the field you want to show the value from.
